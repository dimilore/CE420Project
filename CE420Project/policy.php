            <p><b>Policies and procedures</b></p>
			<p>We, at the STF Pharmaceutical Store, pride ourselves in placing our customers’ privacy high
			on our list of priorities. At every step, we make sure our customers’ privacy is protected and
			their personal information is kept confidential. At the International Drug Mart, we only collect
			relevant and necessary information that we need to carry out our customers’ orders.</p>
            <p><b>Security Measures</b><p>
			<p>At the STF Pharmaceutical Store, we employ very strict security measures to ensure that our 
			customers’ personal information is protected against inappropriate use, disclosure or alteration.

			<p>We employ the latest technology to maintain high security standards and restrict access to 
			electronic flies containing our customers’ data. Our firewall infrastructure is strictly adhered 
			to and we regularly update our security settings.   </p>
			<p><b>Keeping personal information up-to-date</p></b>
			<p>It is highly important for our customers to keep their personal information up-to-date as we, 
			at the STF Pharmaceutical Store, make recommendations and decisions based on the information that
			our customers provide us.</p>

			<p>Customers can access and modify their information in case they wish to make any changes or 
			corrections in case of a clerical error on our part. Once the customer informs us about the 
			incorrect or old information in their file, we carry out the necessary changes. We also make these
			changes known to any other parties who we may have passed the incorrect information onto. 
			<p><b>Updating the policy</b></p>
			<p>From time to time, additions, insertions and modifications may be made to the existing policy. 
			If and when changes are made in our privacy policy and procedures, our customers can come to know
			about it by referring to the modification date found at the bottom of the STF Pharmaceutical Store
			privacy policy web page.</p>
